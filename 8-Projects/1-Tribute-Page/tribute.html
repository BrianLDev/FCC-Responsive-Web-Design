      <h2>More Than 'Just' a Painter</h2>
      <p>Leonardo, an extraordinarily curious and inventive man born in 1452 in the Italian city of Vinci, may be most well-known as a Renaissance painter who created the Mona Lisa, Last Supper, the Vitruvian Man, or (my personal favorite) La Bella Principessa. <i>(see below)</i></p>

      <p>But Leonardo's artistic abilities were but a small fraction of the full depth and breadth of his talents.  In fact, he even seemed to grow bored of painting later in life, and could barely be forced to pick up a brush, let alone finish a painting.  On one occasion, the pope paid him to create a work of art and quickly grew frustrated as Leonardo lingered over the creation of the finishing varnish, before even starting the painting.</p>
        <blockquote>"Alas, this man will never get anything done, for he is thinking about the end before he begins." - The Pope</blockquote>
      <p>Leonardo's insatiable curiousity and passion for knowledge had drawn him to other pursuits, and not even the pope could compel him to paint when the desire was not there. It may be true that Leonardo's perfectionist nature left behind myriad unfinished projects, but to focus solely on that would be to turn a blind eye to the awe inspiring magnitude of what he did accomplish.</p>
      <p>Though he had almost no schooling and was basically self-taught, Leonardo was able to learn and grow into a master of not just one area, but many.  The phrase "jack-of-all-trades" is often followed by "master of none", but the exception to that rule are the poly-maths, the masters of multiple trades, or as we call them today, Renaissance Men.  And while there were many throughout the Renaissance who could lay claim to that title, none moreso than Leonardo.</p>
      <h2>Jack of All Trades, Master of Many</h2>
      <p>Here is a sampling of fields Leonardo had mastered, along with a short example for each</p>
      <h3>Painting</h3>
        <p>Widely regarded as a Master, and one of the greatest painters of all time.  Examples are above.</p>
      <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>In his youth, Leonardo learned to play the lyre (similar to a harp), sing, and improvise lyrics.  He soon gained fame and renown for his talents, and even began crafting his own custom instruments.<p>
      <blockquote>"He was a connoisseur and marvelous inventor of all beautiful things, especially in the field of stage performances, and sang masterfully to his own accompaniment on the lyre. When he played the lyre with the bow, he miraculously pleased all princes." - Paolo Giovio</blockquote>
      <h3>Playwrighting and Pageant Design</h3>
        <p>During his employ under Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo designed, wrote, and orchestrated plays and pageants.  He drew a modest amount of fame for designing <i>The Masque of the Planets</i> and the renown of his contemporaries.</p>
      <h3>Military Strategy</h3>
      <p>Designed interesting and innovative (though often impractical) weapons of war.</p>

      <h3>Cartography</h3>
      <p>Turned map-making into a science, with his extremely detailed and precise maps such as this one of Imola</p>
      <img src="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/archaeologyandhistory/rights-exempt/OG/leonardo-map-og.ngsversion.1590072291683.adapt.1900.1.jpg" alt="Map of Imola">
      <h3>Anatomy & Physiology</h3>
      <p>A pioneer in the study of Anatomy and Physiology, Leonardo drew some of the most accurate anatomical figures of the human body for his time, over 25 years before modern anatomy as we know it began.  He went as far as to perform multiple dissections himself. After one such dissection, he discovered the cause of death to be a heart condition that would not be re-discovered until hundreds of years later.</p>

      <h3>Science & Physics</h3>
        <p>Perhaps most surprising, is that Leonardo was a self-taught scientist, discovering things about the fundamental nature of reality hundreds of years before other scientists re-discovered and popularized them.  I don't have time to write them all out here, but I recommend you explore some of Leonardo's amazing discoveries.</p>
        <p>200 years before Newton published "to every action there is always opposed an equal reaction", Leonardo wrote in one of his notebooks: "As much force is exerted by the object against the air as by the air against the object"</p>
      <h3>Engineering & Inventions</h3>
